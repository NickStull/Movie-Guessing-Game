# Movie-Guessing-Game
The MovieIQ app is a quick and fun movie trivia game that focuses on the top 100 most popular movies. 

## Overview

The MovieIQ app dynamically generates hints for a random top 100 movie based on the pace of each user and their input. The user is presented with a home page setting that stage that this is a top-tier movie experience. Starting with a hero image of the Hollywood sign they can then click the start button when they are ready. 

Clicking the start button brings them to the main game page. At this point the program randomly selects a movie from a list of the 100 most popular movies. The objective of this game is to guess what that movie is based on hints given.

The first thing the user will see is a clean responsive UI that looks great on any size device from mobile to the big screen. They are met with a countdown timer that starts at 60 seconds, an input field where that can guess a movie, two buttons to either get the next hint and a "give up" button to end the round. Most importantly they are presented with the first hint displayed in a card below the header.

The hints are given in a specific order. This order was selected to progressively get more specific as you move through the available hints. The first hint is the Genre. From there they are in this order: Release Date, MPAA Rating, Production Company, Director, Actors, and finally the Plot.

If the user does not guess correctly in the alotted time they are presented with the answer and an opportunity to retry immediately. They also have the option to view the Walk of Fame which lists the top 10 high scores.

If the user guesses the movie correctly, they are presented with a celebration screen with confetti and gifs randomly generated based on the movie's title. They then have the option to view the Walk of Fame and if their score was high enough, place their name on a star and mark their own place on the Walk of Fame.
